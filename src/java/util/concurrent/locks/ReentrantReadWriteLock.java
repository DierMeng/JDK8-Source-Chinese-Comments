/**
 * 读写锁维护了一对相关的锁，一个用于只读操作，一个用于写入操作。只要没有写，读取锁可以由多个读线程同时保持。写入锁是独占的。
 *
 * Sync 的内部类继承了 AQS，AQS 的队列可以同时存放共享锁和独占锁，
 * 对于 ReentrantReadWriteLock 来说分别代表读锁和写锁，
 * 当队列中的头节点为读锁时，代表读操作可以执行，而写操作不能执行，因此请求写操作的线程会被挂起，
 * 当读操作依次退出后，写锁成为头节点，请求写操作的线程被唤醒，可以执行写操作，而此时的读请求将被封装成 Node 放入 AQS 的队列中。
 * 如此往复，实现读写锁的读写交替进行。
 *
 * 适用于读多写少的情况。
 *
 * AQS 的状态是32位（int 类型）的，分成两份，读锁用高 16 位，表示持有读锁的线程数（sharedCount），写锁低16位，表示写锁的重入次数 （exclusiveCount）。
 * 状态值为 0 表示锁空闲，sharedCount不为 0 表示分配了读锁，exclusiveCount 不为 0 表示分配了写锁，sharedCount 和 exclusiveCount 肯定不会同时不为 0。
 *
 * 1  3  5  0  7  9  2  4
 * 读线程 1 申请读锁时，锁是空闲的，马上分配，读线程 3、5 申请时，由于已分配读锁，它们也可以马上获取读锁。
 * 假设此时有线程 11 申请读锁，由于它不是读锁重入，只能等待。而线程1再次申请读锁是可以的，因为它的重入。
 * 写线程 0 申请写锁时，由于分配了读锁，只能等待，当读线程 1、3、5 都释放读锁后，线程 0 可以获取写锁。
 * 线程 0 释放后，线程 7、9 获取读锁，它们释放后，线程 2 获取写锁，此时线程 4 必须等待线程 2 释放。
 * 线程 4 在线程 2 释放写锁后获取写锁，它释放写锁后，锁恢复空闲。
